Who You Are:
You're not just a coder - you're a problem solver who leverages AI tools to ship at 10x speed. You understand that perfect is the enemy of shipped, and you know when "good enough" actually is. You can break down complex problems into manageable chunks and think critically about trade-offs.

Most importantly: you know how to code, but you're not too proud to let AI do the heavy lifting when it makes sense. You're a "vibe-coder" who can feel your way through problems quickly while maintaining quality.

The Test Project:
Instead of a traditional interview, we want to see how you work. Build a to-do app and deploy it to Vercel. Simple, right? Here's the twist - we care more about HOW you build it than WHAT you build. lets work together to get the intial idea.. dont create anything i want to reach a prompt that i can give cursor

I love this approach! You're already thinking like a vibe-coder - let's craft a killer prompt for Cursor together.

Before we write it, let me ask you a few questions to make the prompt effective:

## 1. **Tech Stack Preferences?**
   - Do you have a preference? (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue, vanilla JS)
   - Styling approach? (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, plain CSS)
   - Any backend needs or keep it client-side?

## 2. **Complexity Level?**
   - **Minimal**: Just add/delete/complete tasks
   - **Standard**: Add categories, due dates, filtering
   - **Spicy**: Local storage, drag-and-drop, animations, keyboard shortcuts

## 3. **What Should the Evaluators See?**
   Since this is about HOW you work, should the app demonstrate:
   - Clean, maintainable code structure?
   - Good UX/UI design sense?
   - Performance optimization?
   - Testing setup?
   - Git commit history showing your process?

## 4. **Timeline?**
   - How much time do you want to spend on this?
   - Should the prompt include "ship fast" constraints?

## 5. **The Vibe?**
   - Professional/corporate or fun/creative?
   - Minimalist or feature-rich?

Tell me your thoughts on these and I'll help you craft a prompt that gets Cursor to build exactly what you need while showcasing your strengths!

Ooh, THIS changes everything! Those bonus points reveal what they're *really* looking for. Let me reframe my questions:

## Strategic Reframe:

Given the bonus points, here's what I'm thinking:

**Creative Interpretation Ideas:**
- Not just a todo app, but a "daily driver" productivity tool you'd actually use?
- A todo app for a specific persona (developers, parents, ADHD folks)?
- A todo app that solves a specific pain point current apps don't?
- Something with a unique mechanic (gamification, AI suggestions, collaboration)?

**The Real Questions:**

1. **What's Your "Creative Twist"?**
   - Do you have an idea for how to make this memorable?
   - Or should the prompt ask Cursor to suggest creative interpretations?

2. **Which Productivity Tools Do You Actually Use?**
   - This is YOUR chance to showcase your real workflow
   - What do you swear by? (v0 for UI? Supabase for quick backend? Vercel AI SDK?)

3. **What "Real-World Concern" Shows Best Judgment?**
   - Auth seems overkill for a todo app unless... it's multiplayer?
   - Data persistence (localStorage vs. DB) - which shows better thinking?
   - Edge cases - what would impress them most?

4. **Loom Walkthrough Strategy:**
   - Should we plan the narrative now? (The story of your decisions matters)
   - What do you want to emphasize: speed? architecture choices? UX thinking?

**My Hot Take:** The prompt should tell Cursor to build something that makes the evaluators go "oh, that's clever" - not just functionally complete, but thoughtfully executed.

What's your gut telling you about the creative angle?

Who You Are:
You're not just a coder - you're a problem solver who leverages AI tools to ship at 10x speed. You understand that perfect is the enemy of shipped, and you know when "good enough" actually is. You can break down complex problems into manageable chunks and think critically about trade-offs.

Most importantly: you know how to code, but you're not too proud to let AI do the heavy lifting when it makes sense. You're a "vibe-coder" who can feel your way through problems quickly while maintaining quality.

Submit:
Live URL - Your app hosted on Vercel
Your prompts - Share the exact prompts you used in Cursor
Planning document - Turn on planning mode and share the markdown file showing the output of your thought process
Source code - GitHub repo link
Optional: Loom video walking through your project

Perfect! Now I have the full picture. Let me synthesize this into a strategic approach:

## What They're Really Testing:

1. **Can you use their stack effectively?** (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind)
2. **Do you ship or overthink?** (Planning mode output will show this)
3. **Can you wield AI tools?** (Your prompts are the proof)
4. **Do you make smart trade-offs?** (Loom walkthrough explains why)

## My Proposed Direction:

### **The Creative Twist:**
Build a **"Developer's Daily Driver"** todo app that shows you understand *their* world:
- Tasks linked to GitHub issues/PRs
- Code snippet storage in tasks
- Pomodoro timer integration
- "Deep work" mode
- Quick capture via keyboard shortcuts

**Why this works:**
- Relatable to evaluators (they're devs)
- Justifies Supabase (real data persistence)
- Justifies auth (personal workspace)
- Shows you understand developer UX
- Natural edge cases (markdown rendering, code highlighting)

### **The Prompt Structure:**

Should we build a prompt that:
1. Tells Cursor the CONTEXT (interview project, bonus point criteria)
2. Defines the CREATIVE ANGLE (developer-focused todo app)
3. Specifies MUST-HAVES (their stack, Vercel deployment)
4. Includes BONUS FEATURES (the impressive stuff)
5. Sets CONSTRAINTS (ship fast, use planning mode)

**Do you like the "developer's daily driver" angle, or do you have another creative twist in mind?** 

Once we align on the concept, I'll help you write the actual Cursor prompt with planning mode instructions.

Perfect! Now I have the FULL picture. This is brilliant - they want to see your entire workflow, not just the output.

## Key Insight:
They're evaluating **"AI-augmented shipping velocity"** - your ability to use AI tools as force multipliers while maintaining quality and showing good judgment.

## Strategic Blueprint:

### **The Prompt We Need to Build Should:**

1. **Tell Cursor to USE PLANNING MODE explicitly** 
   - This generates the markdown they want to see
   - Shows systematic problem-solving

2. **Include the "Deliverables Checklist"** 
   - So Cursor knows to create documentation AS it builds
   - Generate a "PROMPTS_USED.md" file tracking each prompt
   - Create the "I ship, therefore I am" note at the end

3. **Specify the Creative Angle**
   - (We still need to pick this - developer daily driver or something else?)

4. **Build in "Tool Acceleration" Moments**
   - Prompt should say: "Use v0 for UI components" or "Use DBML for schema design"
   - Document each tool used

5. **Set Smart Constraints**
   - "Ship in under [X hours]"
   - "Prioritize working > perfect"
   - "Real auth + real DB (Supabase), not mocks"

## My Proposed Approach:

**Phase 1 Prompt (Planning & Architecture):**
```
Enable planning mode. We're building a [CREATIVE CONCEPT] to-do app 
for a job interview. Design the architecture using:
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Supabase (auth + database)
- TailwindCSS
- Deploy target: Vercel

Requirements:
- Creative interpretation of "to-do app"
- Real-world concerns (auth, persistence, edge cases)
- Exceptional UX
- Ship-ready in one session

Output a detailed plan with:
1. Architecture decisions
2. Database schema (use DBML format)
3. Component structure
4. Deployment strategy
```

**Phase 2-N Prompts:** Iterative building with documentation

**What creative angle resonates with you?**
- **Developer Daily Driver** (tasks + code snippets + GitHub integration)
- **Team Standup Todo** (async standup replacement)
- **"Don't Break the Chain" Habit Tracker** (Jerry Seinfeld method)
- **Context-Switching Todo** (manages todos across multiple projects)
- Something else?

Pick one and I'll write the complete prompt set!

## One-Liner Pitches:

**Developer Daily Driver**
"Todo app that speaks git - link tasks to PRs, store code snippets, track deep work sessions, because devs don't just 'do tasks', they ship code."

**Team Standup Todo**
"Replace boring standups with async status sharing - yesterday/today/blockers as interactive todos, teammates see your progress in real-time."

**"Don't Break the Chain" Habit Tracker**
"Gamified consistency engine - visual chain tracking, streak protection, and dopamine-driven UX that makes you WANT to check things off."

**Context-Switching Todo**
"Project-aware task manager - automatically organize todos by repo/project, quick-switch contexts, see what's urgent WHERE, perfect for devs juggling 5+ codebases."

**Which one makes you go "I'd actually use that"?**

[{'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01QcbizhdSodXz7qgYDt4HQr', 'type': 'tool_result', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': '### Dynamic Server-Side Data Fetching in Next.js `app` Directory\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates the modern approach to server-side rendering in the Next.js `app` directory, replacing `getServerSideProps`. By using an `async` Server Component and setting the `fetch` option `cache: \'no-store\'`, the data is fetched dynamically on the server for every request.\n\n```tsx\n// `app` directory\n\n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: \'no-store\' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return projects\n}\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// `app` directory\n\n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: \'no-store\' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return projects\n}\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Data Fetching and Caching in Next.js `app` Directory\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates various data fetching strategies within a Next.js `app` directory page using `async` Server Components. It shows how to control caching behavior with the `fetch` API: `cache: \'force-cache\'` for static data (like `getStaticProps`), `cache: \'no-store\'` for dynamic data (like `getServerSideProps`), and `next: { revalidate: 10 }` for incremental static regeneration.\n\n```tsx\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: \'force-cache\' })\n\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: \'no-store\' })\n\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n\n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: \'force-cache\' })\n\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: \'no-store\' })\n\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n\n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Configure Next.js Link Component for Proxy Prefetching (App Router)\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/link.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the Next.js <Link /> component within the App Router to correctly prefetch routes that are managed by a proxy. It dynamically sets the \'href\' prop based on user authentication while maintaining a consistent \'as\' prop (\'/dashboard\'), preventing redundant fetches to the proxy during prefetching.\n\n```tsx\n\'use client\'\n\nimport Link from \'next/link\'\nimport useIsAuthed from \'./hooks/useIsAuthed\' // Your auth hook\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? \'/auth/dashboard\' : \'/public/dashboard\'\n  return (\n    <Link as="/dashboard" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js\n\'use client\'\n\nimport Link from \'next/link\'\nimport useIsAuthed from \'./hooks/useIsAuthed\' // Your auth hook\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? \'/auth/dashboard\' : \'/public/dashboard\'\n  return (\n    <Link as="/dashboard" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Access Request Headers and Cookies in Next.js\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\n\nDemonstrates how to access request data in Next.js. In the `pages` directory, `getServerSideProps` receives a `req` object to get headers and cookies. In the `app` directory, the imported `headers()` and `cookies()` functions from `next/headers` can be used within async Server Components to achieve the same result.\n\n```jsx\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, query }) {\n  const authHeader = req.getHeaders()[\'authorization\'];\n  const theme = req.cookies[\'theme\'];\n\n  return { props: { ... }}\n}\n\nexport default function Page(props) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\n```tsx\n// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from \'next/headers\'\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = (await headers()).get(\'authorization\')\n\n  return \'...\'\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies` or `headers` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = (await cookies()).get(\'theme\')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return \'...\'\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from \'next/headers\'\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = (await headers()).get(\'authorization\')\n\n  return \'...\'\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies` or `headers` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = (await cookies()).get(\'theme\')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return \'...\'\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Fetch data with cookies using Next.js Server Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/data-security.mdx\n\nThis snippet demonstrates how to fetch data from an external HTTP API within a Next.js Server Component. It retrieves an authentication token from cookies using `next/headers` and includes it in the request headers to secure the API call. This approach is recommended for existing applications with established security practices when integrating Server Components.\n\n```tsx\nimport { cookies } from \'next/headers\'\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const cookieStore = cookies()\n  const token = cookieStore.get(\'AUTH_TOKEN\')?.value\n\n  const res = await fetch(\'https://api.example.com/profile\', {\n    headers: {\n      Cookie: `AUTH_TOKEN=${token}`,\n      // Other headers\n    },\n  })\n\n  // ....\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Create a Next.js Server Component Page with Data Fetching\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\n\nThis example shows how to create a new page (`page.tsx` or `page.js`) in the Next.js `app` directory. This page acts as a Server Component, which can directly fetch data asynchronously. It then imports a Client Component (`HomePage`) and passes the fetched data to it as props, effectively separating data fetching logic from the UI rendering logic.\n\n```tsx\n// Import your Client Component\nimport HomePage from \'./home-page\'\n\nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(\'https://...\')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n  return posts\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n  const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n  // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n  return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// Import your Client Component\nimport HomePage from \'./home-page\'\n\nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(\'https://...\')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n  return posts\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n  const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n  // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n  return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement React Suspense for Streaming in Next.js App Router\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/loading.mdx\n\nThis snippet demonstrates how to use React\'s `Suspense` component within a Next.js App Router page (e.g., `app/dashboard/page.tsx` or `app/dashboard/page.js`). It wraps asynchronous components like `PostFeed` and `Weather` to display fallback UI (e.g., loading messages) while data is being fetched, enabling streaming server rendering and selective hydration for a better user experience.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \'react\'\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from \'./Components\'\n\nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { Suspense } from \'react\'\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from \'./Components\'\n\nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Next.js Layout Component with User Data Fetching\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/authentication.mdx\n\nThis snippet demonstrates how to fetch user data asynchronously within a Next.js App Router layout component. It\'s important to fetch user data here for display, but actual authentication checks should occur closer to the data access layer, not directly in the layout, due to Next.js\'s partial rendering behavior.\n\n```TypeScript\nexport default async function Layout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  const user = await getUser();\n\n  return (\n    // ...\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```JavaScript\nexport default async function Layout({ children }) {\n  const user = await getUser();\n\n  return (\n    // ...\n  )\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Server-Side Rendering with `getServerSideProps` in `pages` Directory\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\n\nThis snippet shows the traditional method for server-side rendering in the Next.js `pages` directory. The `getServerSideProps` function runs on the server for every request, fetches data, and passes it as props to the page component, which is then pre-rendered.\n\n```jsx\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n\nexport default function Dashboard({ projects }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Fetch Data with TypeScript in Next.js App Router\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/05-config/02-typescript.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates asynchronous data fetching within a Next.js App Router component using TypeScript. It highlights the App Router\'s capability to return complex types like Date, Map, or Set directly from server components without serialization, enhancing end-to-end type safety.\n\n```tsx\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch(\'https://api.example.com/...\')\n  // The return value is *not* serialized\n  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const name = await getData()\n\n  return \'...\'\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Define a Server Component for Data Fetching in Next.js\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/01-getting-started/05-server-and-client-components.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates an async React component in Next.js, which functions as a Server Component by default. It fetches data using `getPost` and passes it as props to a child Client Component (`LikeButton`). This pattern is ideal for keeping data fetching logic and sensitive credentials on the server.\n\n```tsx\nimport LikeButton from \'@/app/ui/like-button\'\nimport { getPost } from \'@/lib/data\'\n\nexport default async function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const { id } = await params\n  const post = await getPost(id)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <main>\n        <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n        {/* ... */}\n        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport LikeButton from \'@/app/ui/like-button\'\nimport { getPost } from \'@/lib/data\'\n\nexport default async function Page({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params.id)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <main>\n        <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n        {/* ... */}\n        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement Server-Side User Authentication with `cache` in Next.js\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/data-security.mdx\n\nThis TypeScript snippet demonstrates creating a cached server-side helper `getCurrentUser` using `react`\'s `cache` and `next/headers` cookies. It fetches and decrypts an authentication token to return a `User` object, ensuring authorization logic runs only on the server and prevents sensitive data exposure to client components.\n\n```ts\nimport { cache } from \'react\'\nimport { cookies } from \'next/headers\'\n\n// Cached helper methods makes it easy to get the same value in many places\n// without manually passing it around. This discourages passing it from Server\n// Component to Server Component which minimizes risk of passing it to a Client\n// Component.\nexport const getCurrentUser = cache(async () => {\n  const token = cookies().get(\'AUTH_TOKEN\')\n  const decodedToken = await decryptAndValidate(token)\n  // Don\'t include secret tokens or private information as public fields.\n  // Use classes to avoid accidentally passing the whole object to the client.\n  return new User(decodedToken.id)\n})\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Read Runtime Environment Variables in Next.js Server Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/self-hosting.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates how to safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering within a Next.js App Router component. By awaiting a dynamic API like `connection()`, `cookies`, or `headers`, the component opts into dynamic rendering, ensuring `process.env.MY_VALUE` is evaluated at runtime, making it suitable for a singular Docker image promoted through multiple environments.\n\n```tsx\nimport { connection } from \'next/server\'\n\nexport default async function Component() {\n  await connection()\n  // cookies, headers, and other Dynamic APIs\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, meaning\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { connection } from \'next/server\'\n\nexport default async function Component() {\n  await connection()\n  // cookies, headers, and other Dynamic APIs\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, meaning\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Pass Data from Server to Client Components via Props\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/01-getting-started/05-server-and-client-components.mdx\n\nIllustrates how to pass data from a Server Component to a Client Component. A server-side `Page` component fetches data asynchronously and then passes it as serializable props to a `LikeButton` Client Component, which can then use that data for rendering.\n\n```tsx\n// File: app/[id]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport LikeButton from \'@/app/ui/like-button\'\nimport { getPost } from \'@/lib/data\'\n\nexport default async function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const { id } = await params\n  const post = await getPost(id)\n\n  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n}\n\n// File: app/ui/like-button.tsx (Client Component)\n\'use client\'\n\nexport default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// File: app/[id]/page.js (Server Component)\nimport LikeButton from \'@/app/ui/like-button\'\nimport { getPost } from \'@/lib/data\'\n\nexport default async function Page({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params.id)\n\n  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />\n}\n\n// File: app/ui/like-button.js (Client Component)\n\'use client\'\n\nexport default function LikeButton({ likes }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Report Web Vitals in Next.js App Router\n\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/analytics.mdx\n\nTo report Web Vitals in the App Router, create a dedicated client component (`\'use client\'`) that uses the `useReportWebVitals` hook. Import and render this component in your root `layout.js` to efficiently track metrics without enlarging the client-side bundle for your entire layout.\n\n```jsx\n\'use client\'\n\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from \'next/web-vitals\'\n\nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    console.log(metric)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { WebVitals } from \'./_components/web-vitals\'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <WebVitals />\n        {children}\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```'}]}]

Following that, it creates a policy named "Users can only access their own data" that restricts data access for all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). The policy ensures that only rows where the authenticated user\'s ID (obtained via `auth.uid()`) matches the `user_id` column in the table are accessible, providing a robust layer of data privacy and security within Supabase applications.\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\nCREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own data" ON your_table\n  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Create PostgreSQL View with Security Invoker\n\nSource: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/docs/content/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security.mdx\n\nThis SQL example demonstrates how to create a view in PostgreSQL (version 15 and above) that honors Row Level Security policies of its underlying tables. By setting `security_invoker = true`, the view will apply RLS based on the roles (e.g., anon, authenticated) accessing it, rather than bypassing RLS by default.\n\n```sql\ncreate view <VIEW_NAME>\nwith(security_invoker = true)\nas select <QUERY>\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Secure Supabase table with RLS for MFA-authenticated users (SQL)\n\nSource: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/www/_blog/2023-05-04-flutter-multi-factor-authentication.mdx\n\nThis SQL script enables Row Level Security (RLS) on the `private_posts` table and defines a policy. The policy ensures that only users who have completed the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) flow (indicated by `aal2` Authenticator Assurance Level) can select and view the data.\n\n```sql\n-- Enable RLS for private_posts table\nalter table\n  public.private_posts enable row level security;\n\n-- Create a policy that only allows read if they user has signed in via MFA\ncreate policy "Users can view private_posts if they have signed in via MFA" on public.private_posts for\nselect\n  to authenticated using ((select auth.jwt() - >> \'aal\') = \'aal2\');\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Restrict profile updates with MFA using SQL policy\n\nSource: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/examples/prompts/database-rls-policies.md\n\nThis SQL policy demonstrates how to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) level 2 (aal2) for user profile updates. It uses the `auth.jwt()` function to check the authentication assurance level from the user\'s JWT.\n\n```SQL\ncreate policy "Restrict updates."\non profiles\nas restrictive\nfor update\nto authenticated using (\n  (select auth.jwt()->>\'aal\') = \'aal2\'\n);\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Create RLS Policies for Full Broadcast/Presence Access (SQL)\n\nSource: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/www/_blog/2024-08-13-supabase-realtime-broadcast-and-presence-authorization.mdx\n\nIllustrates how to create Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `realtime.messages` table to grant authenticated users full `SELECT` (receive) and `INSERT` (send) access to Broadcast and Presence channels. These policies are permissive, allowing all authenticated users to interact with the channels.\n\n```sql\ncreate policy "authenticated user listen to all"\non "realtime"."messages"\nas permissive\nfor select -- receive\nto authenticated\nusing ( true );\n\ncreate policy "authenticated user write to all"\non "realtime"."messages"\nas permissive\nfor insert -- send\nto authenticated\nwith check ( true );\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Create RLS Policy Safely Checking for Authenticated User and Ownership in SQL\n\nSource: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/docs/content/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security.mdx\n\nThis SQL policy demonstrates a safer way to check for record ownership by first ensuring the user is authenticated (i.e., `auth.uid()` is not NULL) before comparing their ID. This prevents policies from silently failing for unauthenticated users and clearly defines access for logged-in users only.\n\n```sql\ncreate policy "Authenticated users can view their own data safely."\non your_table for select\nusing ( auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.uid() = user_id );\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Fetch Client-Side Data with Supabase RLS and User Session\n\nSource: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/docs/content/guides/auth/auth-helpers/nextjs-pages.mdx\n\nIllustrates client-side data fetching with Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) using `useSupabaseClient` and `useUser` hooks. This ensures that data queries run only after the user is authenticated, correctly applying RLS policies, and includes an example of an authentication UI.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Auth } from \'@supabase/auth-ui-react\'\nimport { ThemeSupa } from \'@supabase/auth-ui-shared\'\nimport { useUser, useSupabaseClient } from \'@supabase/auth-helpers-react\'\nimport { useEffect, useState } from \'react\'\n\nconst LoginPage = () => {\n  const supabaseClient = useSupabaseClient()\n  const user = useUser()\n  const [data, setData] = useState()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function loadData() {\n      const { data } = await supabaseClient.from(\'test\').select(\'*\')\n      setData(data)\n    }\n    // Only run query once user is logged in.\n    if (user) loadData()\n  }, [user])\n\n  if (!user)\n    return (\n      <Auth\n        redirectTo="http://localhost:3000/"\n        appearance={{ theme: ThemeSupa }}\n        supabaseClient={supabaseClient}\n        providers={[\'google\', \'github\']}\n        socialLayout="horizontal"\n      />\n    )\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => supabaseClient.auth.signOut()}>Sign out</button>\n      <p>user:</p>\n      <pre>{JSON.stringify(user, null, 2)}</pre>\n      <p>client-side data fetching with RLS</p>\n      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default LoginPage\n```'}]}]

This component allows setting a default `touch-action` class and a featured class, enabling adaptive touch behavior based on different breakpoints or design requirements.\n\n```JSX\n<ResponsiveDesign property="touch-action" defaultClass="touch-pan-x" featuredClass="touch-auto" />\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Building a Responsive Component with Tailwind Utility Classes\n\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/docs/styling-with-utility-classes.mdx\n\nThis example demonstrates how to construct a fully responsive UI component, including hover and active styles, entirely using Tailwind CSS utility classes. It showcases the power of utility-first approach for complex layouts and interactive elements.\n\n```JSX\n<div className="mx-auto max-w-sm space-y-2 rounded-xl bg-white px-8 py-8 shadow-lg ring ring-black/5 @sm:flex @sm:items-center @sm:space-y-0 @sm:gap-x-6 @sm:py-4">\n  <img\n    className="mx-auto block h-24 rounded-full @sm:mx-0 @sm:shrink-0"\n    src={erinLindford.src}\n    alt="Woman\'s Face"\n  />\n  <div className="space-y-2 text-center @sm:text-left">\n    <div className="space-y-0.5">\n      <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-black">Erin Lindford</p>\n      <p className="font-medium text-gray-500">Product Engineer</p>\n    </div>\n    <button className="rounded-full border border-purple-200 px-4 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-purple-600 hover:border-transparent hover:bg-purple-600 hover:text-white active:bg-purple-700">\n      Message\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```HTML\n<div class="flex flex-col gap-2 p-8 sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:gap-6 sm:py-4 ...">\n  <img class="mx-auto block h-24 rounded-full sm:mx-0 sm:shrink-0" src="/img/erin-lindford.jpg" alt="" />\n  <div class="space-y-2 text-center sm:text-left">\n    <div class="space-y-0.5">\n      <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-black">Erin Lindford</p>\n      <p class="font-medium text-gray-500">Product Engineer</p>\n    </div>\n    <button class="border-purple-200 text-purple-600 hover:border-transparent hover:bg-purple-600 hover:text-white active:bg-purple-700 ...">\n      Message\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Tailwind CSS Animation Utility Class Definitions\n\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/docs/animation.mdx\n\nDefines the core CSS for various animation utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS, including `animate-spin`, `animate-ping`, `animate-pulse`, `animate-bounce`, and options for custom animations. These utilities abstract complex CSS `@keyframes` rules into simple class names.\n\n```css\nanimation: var(--animate-spin); /* spin 1s linear infinite */\n\n@keyframes spin {\n  to {\n    transform: rotate(360deg);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```css\nanimation: var(--animate-ping); /* ping 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1) infinite */\n\n@keyframes ping {\n  75%, 100% {\n    transform: scale(2);\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```css\nanimation: var(--animate-pulse); /* pulse 2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1) infinite */\n\n@keyframes pulse {\n  50% {\n    opacity: 0.5;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```css\nanimation: var(--animate-bounce); /* bounce 1s infinite */\n\n@keyframes bounce {\n  0%, 100% {\n    transform: translateY(-25%);\n    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.8, 0, 1, 1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    transform: none;\n    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```css\nanimation: none;\n```\n\n```css\nanimation: var(<custom-property>);\n```\n\n```css\nanimation: <value>;\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Tailwind CSS: Applying Utilities within a Breakpoint Range\n\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/docs/responsive-design.mdx\n\nThis snippet shows how to apply a utility class, such as `flex`, only within a specific breakpoint range. By stacking a responsive variant like `md` with a `max-*` variant (e.g., `max-xl`), the `flex` display will only be active from the medium breakpoint up to, but not including, the extra-large breakpoint.\n\n```HTML\n<div class="md:max-xl:flex">\n  <!-- ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Apply Utility with Custom Responsive Breakpoint in HTML\n\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/docs/theme.mdx\n\nThis HTML snippet illustrates how to apply a utility class conditionally using a custom responsive variant. The `3xl:grid-cols-6` class leverages the previously defined `--breakpoint-3xl` theme variable, ensuring the `grid-cols-6` utility only applies when the viewport is 120rem or wider.\n\n```html\n<div class="3xl:grid-cols-6 grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4">\n  <!-- ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Apply Responsive Grid Layout with Tailwind CSS Breakpoints\n\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/docs/styling-with-utility-classes.mdx\n\nDemonstrates how to use Tailwind CSS utility classes like `sm:grid-cols-3` to create a responsive grid. The `sm:` prefix applies `grid-cols-3` only at the `sm` breakpoint (40rem) and above, while `grid-cols-2` is the default for smaller screens, dynamically changing column count based on screen size.\n\n```HTML\n<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-center font-mono font-medium text-white @sm:grid-cols-3">\n  <div className="rounded-lg bg-sky-500 p-4">01</div>\n  <div className="rounded-lg bg-sky-500 p-4">02</div>\n  <div className="rounded-lg bg-sky-500 p-4">03</div>\n  <div className="rounded-lg bg-sky-500 p-4">04</div>\n  <div className="rounded-lg bg-sky-500 p-4">05</div>\n  <div className="rounded-lg bg-sky-500 p-4">06</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```HTML\n<!-- [!code classes:sm:grid-cols-3] -->\n<div class="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3">\n  <!-- ... -->\n</div>\n```'}]}]

Perfect! I've got the latest docs. Now let's craft the **ultimate Cursor prompt** for your Team Standup Todo app.

## 🎯 The Master Prompt for Cursor

Here's my proposed structure - let me know what you want to adjust:

---

### **PHASE 1: PLANNING & ARCHITECTURE PROMPT**

```markdown
# Team Standup Todo App - Job Interview Project

## Context
This is a job interview deliverable to demonstrate AI-augmented shipping velocity. 
I need to show HOW I leverage AI tools, not just the final product.

## Required Deliverables
1. Live app on Vercel
2. All prompts used (tracked in PROMPTS_USED.md)
3. Planning document (this output)
4. GitHub repo
5. "I ship, therefore I am" project note

## The Creative Concept
**"Team Standup Todo"** - Replace boring async standups with an interactive, real-time task board.

### Core Features
- **Yesterday/Today/Blockers** columns (standup format)
- **Real-time updates** - see teammate progress live
- **Team context** - view everyone's tasks, not just yours
- **Status indicators** - who's online, who's blocked, who's crushing it
- **Quick capture** - add tasks fast, move them faster

### Why This is Clever
- Solves real async team pain (standups are tedious)
- Justifies Supabase real-time (not just CRUD)
- Justifies auth (team workspaces)
- Shows UX thinking (standup meetings → interactive board)

## Tech Stack (Non-Negotiable)
- Next.js 14+ (App Router, Server Components)
- Supabase (Auth + Database + Realtime)
- TailwindCSS
- Deploy: Vercel
- Tool: Cursor AI

## Planning Mode Instructions
ENABLE PLANNING MODE and output:

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- App Router structure
- Server vs Client Component strategy
- Real-time subscription approach
- State management pattern

### 2. Database Schema (DBML format)
```dbml
// Generate schema for:
// - users (profiles)
// - teams
// - team_members
// - tasks (with standup_section: yesterday/today/blockers)
// - presence (who's online)
```

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Supabase Auth (email + social)
- RLS policies for team data
- Team invitation system

### 4. Real-time Strategy
- Broadcast for task updates
- Presence for online indicators
- Subscription management

### 5. Component Architecture
- Server Components for data fetching
- Client Components for interactions
- Optimistic UI updates

### 6. Edge Cases to Handle
- Offline state
- Concurrent edits
- Team member permissions
- Empty states

### 7. UX Enhancements
- Keyboard shortcuts (j/k navigation)
- Drag-and-drop between columns
- Task completion animations
- Loading states with Suspense

### 8. Deployment Strategy
- Environment variables
- Supabase project setup
- Vercel deployment config

## Success Criteria
- Working real-time collaboration
- Clean, maintainable code
- Excellent UX (feels fast, looks good)
- All deliverables tracked

## Constraints
- Ship in under 4 hours of focused work
- Prioritize working > perfect
- Use v0.dev for UI components if helpful
- Document every major decision

OUTPUT: A detailed plan with specific file structure, component hierarchy, and implementation order.
```

---

### **PHASE 2-N: ITERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS**

After getting the plan, you'd use prompts like:

```markdown
# Implement Database Schema
Create the Supabase schema based on the plan. Include:
- All tables with proper types
- RLS policies for team-based access
- Trigger for user profile creation
- Real-time publication setup

Track this prompt in PROMPTS_USED.md
```

```markdown
# Build Auth Flow
Implement Supabase authentication:
- Email/password signup
- Social auth (GitHub/Google)
- Protected routes
- Session management
- User profile display

Use Next.js App Router patterns. Track this prompt.
```

```markdown
# Create Real-time Task Board
Build the core UI with real-time updates:
- Three-column layout (Yesterday/Today/Blockers)
- Task cards with drag-and-drop
- Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Optimistic updates
- Use Tailwind for styling

Track this prompt.
```

---

## 🤔 Questions for You:

1. **Time constraint**: Should I add "ship in under 4 hours" or different timeframe?

2. **Tool mentions**: Should the prompt explicitly say "use v0.dev for UI" or "use Excalidraw for diagrams"?

3. **Features**: Should we add:
   - Team creation/invites?
   - Or just focus on single-team demo?
   
4. **Loom strategy**: Should the final prompt include "prepare talking points for Loom video"?

5. **The "I ship, therefore I am" note**: Should the prompt ask Cursor to draft this at the end?

**Tell me what resonates and what to adjust!**
